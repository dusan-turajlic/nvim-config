# My NeoVim configs
I created this repo so I can verson my NeoVim configs across all my devices.

## Requerments
This cofig has a few plugins. Not gonna write them out beucase it will get outdated quite fast.
Instead I'll add some info about what can go wrong on a fresh install.

You need RipGrep
```shell
brew install ripgrep
```

Treesitter uses some xcode developer tools so make sure to run
```shell
code-select --install
```

I'm also using NerdFonts. Hack to be exact. [Download that one](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Hack).
